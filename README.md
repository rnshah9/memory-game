This application simulates a basic matching game played with pairs of identical cards. The goal of the game is to eliminate all the cards, which can only be accomplished by correctly matching them up. However, the user can only have up to two cards face up at a time, meaning they must remember locations of unflipped cards.

The program currently only works with text, but the user may enter as many words/phrases as they like,  and the appropriate number of cards will be generated. The user may also reset the game at any time.
